    <h1>Salmon with Asparagus</h1>

    <h2>Greek Sheet Pan Salmon and Asparagus</h2>
    <p>This Greek-inspired one-pan meal is simple to make and perfect for busy weeknights. Guests will love this too! Serve with a side of rice, if desired. I prefer to use thick center-cut pieces of salmon, as they tend to remain more moist.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 ½ pounds salmon fillet</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon garlic salt</li>
        <li>1 pound fresh asparagus, trimmed</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons lemon juice</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons Greek seasoning</li>
        <li>¼ cup crumbled feta cheese</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons Kalamata olives, pitted and finely chopped</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Cut salmon into 4 even pieces and place in the middle of the prepared sheet pan. Sprinkle with garlic salt. Scatter asparagus around salmon.</li>
        <li>Stir together olive oil, lemon juice, and Greek seasoning in a small bowl. Combine feta cheese and olives in a second bowl.</li>
        <li>Brush half the oil mixture over salmon and drizzle the remainder over the asparagus.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until salmon easily flakes with a fork, 12 to 15 minutes, depending on thickness of the salmon. Sprinkle salmon with feta mixture during the last 5 minutes of cooking.</li>
    </ol>
