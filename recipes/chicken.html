    <h2>Kung Pao Chicken</h2>
    <p>This spicy kung pao chicken is similar to what is served in Chinese restaurants. It's easy to make, and you can be as creative with the measurements as you want. The sauce reduces until nice and thick. Substitute cashews for peanuts, or bamboo shoots for the water chestnuts. You can't go wrong! Enjoy!</p>
